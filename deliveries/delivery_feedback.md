# Software Architecture (2020) - Feedback on Deliverables


## Deliverable list
- Sept 29th: scope
- Oct 6th: component diagram, roadmap, plan.
- Nov 6th: code and slides for oral defense

## Scope
In the `architecture.pdf` document of the `deliverables`folder (as intructed in main Readme), include a textual description of the scope. What you intent to cover from a functionaly standpoint, what is excluded, who are your users/personas.

## Video expectation
You need to deliver a (max) 3 minute video, hosted on a streaming website, which states the challenges you've encountered with the requirement changes of December, how you managed to overcome them, why you made the choice you made, and then a capture of the demo proving it works.
3 min is a very short time. This is precisely the goal of the exercise, you need to be concise and to the point.
